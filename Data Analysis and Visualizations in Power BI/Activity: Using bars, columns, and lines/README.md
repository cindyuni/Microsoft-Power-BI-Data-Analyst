## Introduction
Previously, you learned about different chart types in Microsoft Power BI, including line charts, various bar and column charts, as well as area and stacked area charts. These visualizations are popular for displaying data in a clear and organized way.

In this activity, you will apply some of your newly gained knowledge by creating a comprehensive report for Adventure Works using these visualizations. Specifically, you will:
1. Import the provided sales dataset, Using bars, columns, and lines, provided in Step 1 below.
2. Present the February, March, and April sales trends across all regions using a line chart.
3. Display the distribution of canceled orders, shipped orders, and orders under processing individually in all regions during the quarter using a clustered column chart.
4. Display the order quantity across all regions during this time using a stacked bar chart.

## Result Preview
- Add a line chart to illustrate sales trends over time
- Add a clustered column chart to display the distribution of order statuses
- Add a stacked bar chart to demonstrate differences in order quantity across different regions
