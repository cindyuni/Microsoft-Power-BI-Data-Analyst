## Introduction
Previously, you learned about pie, donut, and treemap charts in Microsoft Power BI. These visualizations are useful for representing proportional data. In this step-by-step activity, you will apply some of your newly gained knowledge by updating the report you created previously. You'll add a pie chart that displays product breakdown by order quantities. To complete this activity, you have to:

1. Open the exercise file you previously created in Power BI and make space for a new visual.
2. Incorporate a pie chart that displays the product categories and their corresponding order quantities for February, March, and April.
3. Hide the legend to declutter the chart.

## Result Preview
