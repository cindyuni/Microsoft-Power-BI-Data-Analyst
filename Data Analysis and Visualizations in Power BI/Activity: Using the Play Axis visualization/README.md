## Scenario
As Adventure Works' fiscal year-end approaches, the sales team shifts their focus towards evaluating year-long results. A decision is made to put together a report that highlights the team's achievements over the past year.

You take on the task of creating a time-series analysis report, delving into the sales data accumulated throughout the year. However, you decide to add a surprising twist - incorporating a Play-axis visual. 

This dynamic feature not only enhances interactivity but also promises to grab everyone's attention and provide a unique perspective on the year's sales performance.
