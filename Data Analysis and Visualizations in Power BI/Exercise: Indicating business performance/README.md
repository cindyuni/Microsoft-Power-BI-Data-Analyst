## Introduction
Your manager, Adio, asks you to prepare a report for the sales team at Adventure Works displaying key performance indicators (KPIs). The stakeholders need your report to answer a variety of KPI-related questions, including:

- What are the total sales and average sales?
- What are the monthly total sales?
- What is the total number of orders placed during this time period?
- What is the total marketing expenditure, and what is the monthly marketing expenditure?
- What is the change in sales over time for the sales teams, and how does this correlate with marketing spending?
- What sales region had the highest sales during this time period, and how did their ranking change over time?
- What is the performance of different sales regions with their advertising campaigns?

To complete this task, your manager provides you with a sales dataset for the last three months containing total sales volume and advertising spending for various sales regions. Each of these regions runs different advertising campaigns.
