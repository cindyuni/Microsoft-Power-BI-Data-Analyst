## Introduction
Your manager, Adio, asks you to prepare a report for the sales team at Adventure Works displaying key performance indicators (KPIs). The stakeholders need your report to answer a variety of KPI-related questions, including:

- What are the total sales and average sales?
- What are the monthly total sales?
- What is the total number of orders placed during this time period?
- What is the total marketing expenditure, and what is the monthly marketing expenditure?
- What is the change in sales over time for the sales teams, and how does this correlate with marketing spending?
- What sales region had the highest sales during this time period, and how did their ranking change over time?
- What is the performance of different sales regions with their advertising campaigns?

To complete this task, your manager provides you with a sales dataset for the last three months containing total sales volume and advertising spending for various sales regions. Each of these regions runs different advertising campaigns.

## Result Preview

Based on the analysis performed in Power BI, the following key insights and trends can be concluded:

- **Total and average sales**: The total sales for the business across all regions from January to March amount to approximately $1.04 million, with an average monthly sale of approximately $64.75K per order.

- **Sales across regions**: When looking at the regional breakdown from the ribbon chart, the East and South regions (Team B) have higher sales when compared to the North and West regions (Team A), indicating better overall performance.

- **Number of orders**: The total number of distinct orders placed during this period is around 16. This provides an insight into the volume of transactions that were processed.

- **Marketing expenditure**: The total marketing expenditure during this period amounts to about $126K. In a monthly breakdown, marketing spend has seen a consistent increase which aligns with the objective of driving up sales.

- **Sales and marketing expenditure relationship**: The waterfall chart indicates a positive correlation between sales and marketing spending. As the marketing expenditure increased, sales also grew. However, the ad campaigns run by Team B were more successful than Team A. An extra $17,000 spent on marketing brought approximately $223K of sales for Team B in July. On the other hand, an extra $20,000 marketing budget brought only $65K in sales for Team A in July.

- **Region performance and ranking**: The ribbon chart reveals that the East region consistently performed the best in terms of sales. However, even with substantial advertising spend, the West region did not perform proportionally well in sales, indicating potential issues with their advertising campaigns.
