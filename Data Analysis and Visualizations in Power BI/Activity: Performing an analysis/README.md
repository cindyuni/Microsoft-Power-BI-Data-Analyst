## Introduction
In your Microsoft Power BI analytics journey thus far, you have learned about statistical summary, groups and bins, histograms, **Top N analysis**, and **clustering**. In this step-by-step exercise, you will apply some of your newly gained knowledge to enhance the three visualizations in the report, Adventure Works Fact Sales.xlsx, using Power BI analytics. 

Your task is to:

1. Enhance the funnel chart by highlighting the top 10 selling products by sales amount.
2. Enhance the clarity of the histogram by using age bins instead of distinct ages.
3. Enhance the scatter chart by clustering the cities into four categories according to their performance.
