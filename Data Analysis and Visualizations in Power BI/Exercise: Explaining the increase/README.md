## Introduction
One of the essential tasks of the marketing department in any business is to monitor the company's performance, assess trends, and highlight any unusual results or anomalies. In a retail environment, they would keep track of the sales performance over time and identify any unusual rise or fall in results. This vital information allows the business to quickly rectify errors or capitalize on positive results. 

In this exercise you will explore how you can use Microsoft Power BI features to quickly identify this type of crucial data. You will be asked to identify the two big sales spikes in the dataset and analyze them. You will apply the clustering technique to separate the data points into similar categories and then use the explain the increase tool of the Analyze feature to generate and add visualizations in your report and identify the driving factors behind this increase. 

## Case study
The marketing department at Adventure Works has identified an unexpected surge in bike sales on two distinct days in the previous month. Once they notified the senior management team of this sharp increase, the information caught the eye of the CEO. They have informed the marketing department that they are keen to identify the contributing factors behind this growth so that the company can capitalize on it and propel the business forward. 

The manager of the marketing department has asked the analytics department to determine the reason for the surge in bike sales. It is important that the contributing factors are identified quickly as they may be time-specific and if so, the company would need to move quickly to take advantage of them and generate more business. After a brief discussion with your manager Jamie, you both feel that Microsoft Power BIâ€™s Analyze feature would be the most effective tool to rapidly generate visualizations that could uncover the driving forces behind the sales surge.
