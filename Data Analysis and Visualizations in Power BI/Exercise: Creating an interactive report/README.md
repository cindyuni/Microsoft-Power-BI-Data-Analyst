## Introduction
Giving stakeholders the ability to dive into report data to explore summaries and insights is an essential role for a data analyst. As different stakeholders bring different viewpoints, an interactive report will enable various discoveries and help unlock key business decisions. In this exercise, you will learn how to use Power BI to enable user interactions in reports and encourage engagement with the data.

## Case study
You are preparing a quarterly sales report for the CEO of Adventure Works. After analyzing the data, you identify some key insights into the Mountain Bike product category and how the products in this category peak at the end of the first quarter (Q1) in preparation for summer.

As a data analyst, you know it is your role to bring these insights to the CEO to enable effective decision-making. As part of the final preparations, to improve the user experience and highlight the key insight into mountain bike sales, you decide to do the following:

- Configure drillthrough to allow for data exploration.

- Allow for easy filtering of product categories using a slicer.

- Provide a convenient bookmark to reload the report with the key insight highlighted.
