## Introduction 
So far, in the Designing an accessible report lesson, you explored the importance of accessibility in reporting and designing accessible reports in Microsoft Power BI. You'll now apply the knowledge you've gained to create an accessible report. In this activity, you will improve the accessibility of an existing Adventure Works sales report using formatting, themes, and design best practices as follows:

- Enhance the accessibility of the visuals using descriptive titles, markers, alt text, and accessible coloring.

- Improve the accessibility of the overall report by changing the tab order and using themes.

- Discuss the improvements made to the report, outlining their benefit for users with disabilities.

## Case study
Adventure Works recently welcomed new members to its sales team, including Logan, who is visually impaired. Committed to inclusivity, the directors have asked the data analytics team to ensure all reports are accessible, aiming to make them more user-friendly for a wider audience. You are assigned the task of incorporating accessibility features to enhance and refine an existing report that contains sales data for the months of February, March, and April across various sales regions, aligning with the best practices you have learned.

## Result Preview


The following improvements were made to enhance the accessibility of the Power BI report, with a focus on improving the experience for visually impaired users such as Logan:

- **Descriptive titles**: The titles of the report and each chart were made more descriptive. This enables all users can quickly and easily grasp the report's purpose and the content of each chart.

- **Alt text**: Alternative text descriptions were provided for each chart visual, aligning with inclusive design best practices. This allows users with visual impairments to understand the visualized data, for example, via screen readers. The alt text can also support all users in understanding the purpose and key insights of each chart.

- **Markers**: Markers were added to the line chart. This enhances the accessibility of the visual by providing users with an alternative way to distinguish between data points that is not solely reliant on color.

- **Shaded colors**: Shaded colors were introduced to enhance color contrast within the charts. This helps visually impaired users distinguish between different chart elements more easily.

- **Tab order**: Tab orders for these visuals were changed in the report. This allows users to easily navigate between different elements and sections of the report using their keyboard, which is particularly useful for users with motor difficulties, such as challenges with using a mouse.

- **Accessible theme**: An accessible theme was implemented, designed with features like large, legible fonts and a high-contrast color palette. These features improve the readability and overall accessibility of the report.

These improvements make the report more accessible and create an inclusive environment where all users, regardless of their abilities, can understand and interact effectively with the data.
