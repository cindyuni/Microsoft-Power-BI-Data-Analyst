## Introduction 
So far, in the Designing an accessible report lesson, you explored the importance of accessibility in reporting and designing accessible reports in Microsoft Power BI. You'll now apply the knowledge you've gained to create an accessible report. In this activity, you will improve the accessibility of an existing Adventure Works sales report using formatting, themes, and design best practices as follows:

- Enhance the accessibility of the visuals using descriptive titles, markers, alt text, and accessible coloring.

- Improve the accessibility of the overall report by changing the tab order and using themes.

- Discuss the improvements made to the report, outlining their benefit for users with disabilities.

## Case study
Adventure Works recently welcomed new members to its sales team, including Logan, who is visually impaired. Committed to inclusivity, the directors have asked the data analytics team to ensure all reports are accessible, aiming to make them more user-friendly for a wider audience. You are assigned the task of incorporating accessibility features to enhance and refine an existing report that contains sales data for the months of February, March, and April across various sales regions, aligning with the best practices you have learned.
