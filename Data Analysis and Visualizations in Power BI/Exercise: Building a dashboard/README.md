## Introduction
You're part of the data analytics team at Adventure Works, responsible for transforming streams of raw data from around the globe about products, sales, and customers into a strategic tool to support business success. The company's CEO relies on you to provide insights that empower her to quickly and effectively understand the complex narrative of the company's performance. Microsoft Power BI's dashboarding capabilities are your answer to condensing an ocean of data into a few clear, digestible visuals. That's why, in this exercise, you'll practice creating an executive summary dashboard in Power BI for the CEO of Adventure Works.

## Case study
In Power BI, a dashboard is a collection of visuals, reports, and other data that provides a consolidated view of business data, making it an essential tool for any executive. In preparation for building your dashboard, your manager gives you three separate reports: Adventure Works Product Sales Report, Adventure Works Customer Report, and Adventure Works Order Report. Each report contains specific visuals that tell a unique part of the business story. Your task is to gather the most important elements from these reports and bring them together to create the executive dashboard.
