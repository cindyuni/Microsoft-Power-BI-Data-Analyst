## Introduction
In the previous week of this course, you discovered more about the stages in the data analysis process, focusing on data collection, processing, and transformation. You learned that data analysts need to identify and engage with stakeholders, identify data sources, and evaluate the data early in the data analysis process. In this exercise, you’ll engage with these tasks to consolidate your learning.

## Case study
You’re a part of the data analytics team at Adventure Works. The lead data analyst, Adio, informs you that the company wants an in-depth analysis of sales data from the past year to understand sales trends and customer preferences. This isn't a routine analysis. The company is close to launching a new product line next quarter. Your analysis and insights will guide this massive product launch, including the marketing strategy, sales approach, and even the final tweaks to the product! Each number, trend, and pattern you uncover from the dataset could directly impact hundreds of decisions. 

You are assigned some initial tasks related to stakeholder engagement, data collection, and data processing—some early steps in the data analysis process that will contribute to the success of the project.
