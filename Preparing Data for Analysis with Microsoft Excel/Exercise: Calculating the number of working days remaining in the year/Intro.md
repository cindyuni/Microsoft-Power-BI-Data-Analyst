## Introduction

By now, you have explored a range of functions that you can use to generate date and time results in your spreadsheets. 

In this exercise, you’ll use this knowledge to generate date information and date calculations to help with the development of a project plan. You’ll use the functions **TODAY, NETWORKDAYS, MONTH, and YEAR** to add some important milestone information to a spreadsheet.

## Case study

Adventure Works is preparing a series of advertising campaigns to be rolled out in several different regions. A colleague, Lucas, has asked you to update a spreadsheet that focuses on the launch dates for the USA campaign. The spreadsheet is called Advertising Campaign USA Dates.xlsx.

- For each project, Lucas needs to know the following information:

- The number of working days available between the start date and the deadline date.

- The month and year when each campaign will launch.

- The number of calendar days to the deadline date for each campaign.

Let’s begin creating the formulas that will generate this information for Lucas.
