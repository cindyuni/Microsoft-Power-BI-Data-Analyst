## Introduction
By now, you should be more familiar with common issues that can arise with text-based data. You have explored a range of functions designed to modify text entries and eliminate data problems.

In this exercise, you’ll put this knowledge into practice by creating calculations to clean company data. You’ll use the functions **TRIM, UPPER, PROPER, LEFT, MID, RIGHT, and CONCAT** to clean the data and prepare it for analysis.

## Case study
A colleague, Lucas, has asked you to update a spreadsheet called Reseller Details that records details of Adventure Work’s resellers in the United States. This information in the spreadsheet was downloaded from another system. The download process created several inconsistencies or errors within the data.

These errors include unnecessary spaces, the use of the wrong case, and entries that need to be joined together or split apart. 

You now need to add formulas to the worksheet to **standardize the data** so that it can be used for analysis.
