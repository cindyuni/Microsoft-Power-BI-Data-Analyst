## Introduction
By now, you should be more familiar with the core functions of SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, and MIN in Microsoft Excel. You have explored how to use these functions in formulas in a variety of ways. 

In this exercise, you will put this knowledge into practice by creating function calculations to generate results in a monthly sales report. To complete this sales report, you will need to create formulas using the five core functions.

## Case study
You are helping a colleague, Lucas, to create an Excel worksheet that tracks the sales results for one of Adventure Works' most popular products, the A2Mountain Bike Frame. Lucas must present the results during Adventure Worksâ€™ monthly sales review meeting. You need to add formulas to the worksheet to complete this report for Lucas.
