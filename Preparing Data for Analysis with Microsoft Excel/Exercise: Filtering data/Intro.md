## Introduction
By now, you should be familiar with the filtering feature in Microsoft Excel. This feature allows you to organize content so that you can read and identify data quickly and efficiently. This makes it easier to analyze your data.

In this exercise, you’ll use the filters to find key information in the worksheet data. By the time you complete this activity, you’ll be able to use the filter technique to perform a simple analysis of the information in the worksheet. 

## Case study
Jamie from Adventure Works has emailed you questions about the inventory file you are working on.

She needs you to find the following numbers and submit them to her:

- The number of listings for gear components.

- The number of orders placed with Z123 in 2023.

- The number of orders placed with Z123 in 2022.

- The number of orders for mountain bike frames.

- The number of mountain bike orders with a stock level of over 500.

You will need to use the **Filter** feature to extract the information from the file required to answer these questions.
