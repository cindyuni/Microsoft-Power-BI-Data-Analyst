## Introduction
So far, you’ve learned that it’s challenging to identify patterns within unstructured flat data that lacks organization or grouping. Using Power Query, you can transform your flat data into a structured tabular format, aggregating values for each unique value in a designated column. Power Query conducts grouping and aggregate calculations for every individual value in the column, and then pivots the column into a new table, the transformation enabling you to structure your data and analyze it more effectively. In this step-by-step activity, you’ll gain hands-on experience in applying the pivot operation in Power BI. 

## Apply a pivot
In this activity, you will convert an Adventure Works Excel file called Product-Color Model.xlsx  that includes Product ID, Color, and Model data. You need to **present the product count per color in a tabular format**. To do this, you need to import the Excel data first and then pivot columns by using aggregate functions. Follow the steps below to apply a pivot in Power BI.
