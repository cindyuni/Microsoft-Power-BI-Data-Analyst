## Introduction
By now, you should understand the concept of data merging and its practical applications. During this week you’ve learned about the concepts of join types, what a join key is and where it can be used. Remember, joins are one of the most basic and important operations in Microsoft Power BI and generally in all database systems. 

In this exercise, you’ll have the opportunity to apply your knowledge by using Power Query to join two data sources; explore the relationships between two tables and match the related data.


## Case study
Adventure Works has data with details, such as Sales Order ID, Order Date, Product Key, Quantity, Unit Price, Reseller Key, Product, Reseller and some other fields are stored in separate tables. These tables have a relationship with the Sales table because of the relational data architecture. 

As you have learned before, although this relational data structure provides data integrity, it only shows the key values. To list the other details of the related tables, you must merge tables with joins. 

Your manager, Adio Quinn, has assigned a task to you to list the Sales data with the Sales Order ID, Order Date, Product Name, Quantity and Unit Price columns. To do this, you must merge the Sales and Product tables by creating a Power BI query that merges the data.

Adio sends you the two .xlsx files containing the Adventure Works company sales data named Sales.xlsx, and product data named Product.xlsx. The data sets have a common column named ProductKey. You will use the common column and match the columns. You need to read data from the two tables.

1. This exercise aims to assist you in understanding how to combine data by merging data.

2. By the end of this exercise, you’ll understand how to merge data in Power Query, to explore the relationships between two tables and match the related data.
