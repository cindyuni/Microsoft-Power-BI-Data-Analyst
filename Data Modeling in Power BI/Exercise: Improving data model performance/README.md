## Introduction
In this exercise, you must apply your optimization knowledge to identify performance issues and implement optimization in an Adventure Work Microsoft Power BI report. You will be asked to:

- Use **Data view** to examine the data in the report.

- Utilize **Model view** to identify a relationship that requires modification.

- Modify the relationship and adjust the **Cardinality** and **Cross-filter** direction settings.

## Scenario
Adventure Works is experiencing problems with a key Power BI report. The interface lags, and the visuals are very slow to load. Your manager asks you to help with these issues.

You quickly discover that the reported issues are caused by an unoptimized, bulky data model that accesses and loads the data at a slow pace. To improve the report's performance and efficiency, you must optimize its current data model.

## Result Preview

The relationship between Customers and Orders have been set to **One-to-many**, and the Cross filter direction is **single**.
