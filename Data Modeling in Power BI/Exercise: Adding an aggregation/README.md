## Introduction
You have gained a thorough understanding of creating and managing aggregations in Microsoft Power BI while working with a DirectQuery connection. You have also learned how aggregations can help improve query performance. 

In this exercise, you can apply this knowledge by creating and managing an aggregation in Power BI using import data. You will also be able to observe how significantly it reduces the size of the data table.

By completing this exercise, you will demonstrate your ability to:

- **Create an aggregation based on specific granularity of analytics.**

- **Configure the data types of aggregated columns and source columns.**

- **Manage the aggregation in Power BI desktop.**

## Scenario
One of the Adventure Works data sets used in a Power BI report is very large. The report performance has been negatively impacted by the need to query the entire data table each time a user interacts with visuals and filters. You feel that creating an aggregation will solve the issue.

To implement this solution, you must create a new aggregated table, establish relationships, and then manage the aggregations within Microsoft Power BI desktop.

 Adventure Works provides a Power BI project file called AdventureWorks.pbix. that contains the required data model and an Excel spreadsheet Adventure Works Data.xlsx.  You must download these files and load it into Power BI.
