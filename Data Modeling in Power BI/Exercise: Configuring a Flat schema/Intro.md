## Introduction
At this stage of the course, you should now have a good understanding of three data models commonly used for data analysis in Power BI. 

In this exercise, you can apply your knowledge of these data models to configure the Flat schema.

You will walk through the steps to create a Flat schema in Power BI using the example of an online bicycle store called Adventure Works.

You'll demonstrate how the store uses a schema to consolidate and analyze data, leading to better business decisions.

## Scenario
Adventure Works has seen a rise in customer complaints following incorrect and delayed deliveries. The company suspects inconsistencies in its data have caused the issues.

To fix these issues, Adventure Works needs to create a data model in Power BI that accurately and consistently organizes and integrates its data. You can help the company to develop this data model as a Flat schema. 

The company provides you with an Excel file called AdventureWorksDataSet. The file consolidates all required data into a table containing all relevant fields related to the companyâ€™s products and orders.

You must load this dataset into Power BI and develop it as a Flat schema. Be sure to evaluate the data quality and configure the model to ensure that Adventure Works can use it to make informed decisions.
