## Introduction
You should now understand the fundamentals of DAX and time intelligence at this lesson stage.

This exercise asks you to apply your knowledge of these concepts by creating measures using DAX expressions in Power BI.

**By completing this exercise, you will demonstrate your ability to:**

**-Create measures to compare Adventure Works' year-over-year sales growth.**

**- Form measures for an appropriate data type.**

**- Create a matrix to view the results of the time intelligence comparison.**

## Scenario
Adventure Works needs to analyze the performance of its sales team and growth to plan for the next financial year. The company needs your help to generate the insights required to build this business plan. 

Begin by helping Adventure Worksto evaluate its sales from the previous year to compare the sales team's performance for the current year. Then calculate Adventure Works' year-over-year change in sales to analyze the company’s growth and monthly and annual trends in sales volume.

Adventure Works provides a Power BI project file called AdventureWorks.pbix that contains the required data model. You must load this dataset into Power BI, evaluate the data quality, and configure the model to ensure that Adventure Works can use it to make informed decisions.

## Result Preview
A matrix view of the measure’s results is visible in the diagram below.
