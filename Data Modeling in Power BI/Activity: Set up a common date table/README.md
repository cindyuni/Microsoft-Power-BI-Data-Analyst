## Introduction
In this lesson, you’ve explored the significance of a common-date table in a data model. You’ve also reviewed the process for creating a common-date table in your models using both DAX and M language in Power BI

In this exercise, you must apply your knowledge of DAX and Power Query to generate a date dimension table within a data model.

You’ll walk through the steps to create a date dimension table using DAX in Power BI.

The goal is understanding how Power BI allows you to control your data model according to your analytical needs.

## Case study
Adventure Works collects data from a range of different sources and collates this data in a data model that contains the following  tables:

- Sales

- Salesperson

- Products

- Reseller

- And Region

**However, there’s no date dimension table in these datasets. This makes it difficult to perform time intelligence analysis. 
Help Adventure Works to create a common-date table in its data model using DAX.**
