## Introduction
You’ve already gained knowledge of the different ways to optimize the data model in a Microsoft Power BI report. You have been shown techniques to optimize columns and metadata and how to use the Auto date/time feature to the best advantage.

In this exercise, you will apply this knowledge by taking the following series of actions to optimize a data model:

Identify and remove unnecessary columns.

Categorize the data.

Adjust data types for memory efficiency.

Disable the Auto date/time feature when it’s not beneficial.

## Case Study
An Adventure Works Microsoft Power BI report is running slowly. You have been asked to make changes to improve the report's performance. The report is based on a large dataset that contains a large amount of transactional sales data. You will implement several changes to optimize the data model, which will help generate a fast, efficient, and impactful Power BI report. 

Optimizing columns and the **Auto date/time** feature is about ensuring that each piece of data, each column, and each feature is functioning as efficiently as possible, and contributing to the smooth, swift execution of the report.
