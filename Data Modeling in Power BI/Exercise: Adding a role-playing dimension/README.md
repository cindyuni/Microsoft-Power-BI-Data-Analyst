## Introduction
You have gained a good understanding of measures and how to create them using DAX and using the quick measure feature of Power BI. 

In this exercise, you must apply your knowledge of measures by writing DAX expressions in Power BI for Adventure Works. You go through each step of creating a new measure calculation within your data model to enhance the reporting visualization and answer specific business questions.

**By completing this exercise, you will demonstrate your ability to:**

**- Create a quick measure from the existing dataset within your data model.**

**- Create a measure by writing DAX expression.**

**- Format the measures for an appropriate data type.**

## Scenario
Adventure Works needs your help calculating its sales data using quick measures and DAX. Its main objective is to compute the running total for sales of its product line. This accumulated data will help the company analyze its sales trend based on various factors, like time, categories, salespersons, and resellers. It can then use these insights to make informed decisions.

Adventure Works provides a Power BI project file called AdventureWorks.pbix. that contains the required data model. You must load this dataset into Power BI, evaluate the data quality, and configure the model to ensure that Adventure Works can use it to make informed decisions.
